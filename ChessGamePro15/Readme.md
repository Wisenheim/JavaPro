# ChessGamePro
It's the chess game written in Java using the Swing library, without AI consideration, just a simple game between humans unfortunately.

The project has the goal to write clean and understandable `Java Code`, using the pattern MVC. It contains also the `Junit tests` in a clear way that gives the reader a clear idea of what the Java code is doing.
